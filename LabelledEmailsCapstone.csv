 ""Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu

will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to
discuss them.

"Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to
discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are
typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our
control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the
commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)
should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are
there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,

Here is a list of the top items we need to work on to improve the position
and p&l reporting for the west desk.
My underlying goal is to create position managers and p&l reports that
represent all the risk held by the desk
and estimate p&l with great accuracy.


Let's try and schedule a meeting for this Wednesday to go over the items 
above.

"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.",FALSE

Is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about

gas desk is included.",TRUE
"Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed
doors """"in smoke filled rooms"""", if not directly between Commissioners then
among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that
the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large
part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which
the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty
strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the
agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray",FALSE
"Johnnie,      

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Thank you,",FALSE
"Jaques,

After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different 
definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a 
superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third
party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of """"construction management""""
fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be
paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally
the builders profit of 1.4 million.

Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out
of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if 
they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition
to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been
in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and
the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management
fee is included.

George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will
review and let you know what I think.

The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to
the 3 out 4 approval process.

Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only
true costs + 1.4 million.

Phillip",FALSE
"Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.",FALSE
"From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical,
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms,
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit
and explicit position break out issues. -- Allan.

"John,

Two items:

1.  I spoke to John McKay about Sumas.  His views seem well thought out.  He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.  See attached spreadsheet.  In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.  But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.  Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40 
        His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet.  Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium.
        In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book.

"Hunter, Scott, Tom & Barry,
We have been meeting with the Ocean Energy, Inc. (""""OEI"""") management team over the last several months discussing the asset management of OEI's gas, as well as  Enron's ability to provide additional Producer Services (including the operations of certain pipeline facilities, outsourcing services and Enron systems outsourcing). We are moving forward with the project and have divided it into two phases. Phase 1: will be the purchase of OEI's natural gas in North America, both operated and non-operated properties, and Phase 2: will evaluate the opportunity to provide OEI additional services.
For Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy  until September 30, 2001.
Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity.
OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions.
In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration.  Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings.
The North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five operating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and East Texas. In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential exploration prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and the Permian Basin.
This opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request  bids for each of the gas packages.
